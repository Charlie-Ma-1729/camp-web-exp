        <pre style="text-align: center;">
            Candlelight and moonlight all around us
            I look into your eyes
            You hold my hand underneath the table
            And I can't disguise the way I feel
            I could've wished a thousand wishes
            For this night, I can't believe
            That it's finally me and you, and you and me
            Just us, and your friend Steve
            Do-do-do-do-do-do, Steve
            Do-do-do-do-do-do, leave
            What's the deal with your friend Steve?
            Hey, how's it going?
            You took me out for waffles and to the movies
            I was hoping for romance
            You even took me to the Mexican circus
            I thought there was a chance we'd be alone
            I could've wished a thousand wishes
            For Steve to disappear
            What the fuck's your fucking problem?
            Why's he always here?
            Do-do-do-do-do-do, Steve
            Do-do-do-do-do-do, go away
            What's the deal with your friend Steve?
            Hey, how's it going?
            It's not that I don't like your friend
            But how many hours with him can you spend?
            And it's not that I don't think he's great
            But its only you, only you, I wanna fellate
            Are you gay for Steve?
            I think you may be
            And that would be alright
            But let a bitch know just what your steez is
            So, I know if I should shave tonight
            I could've wished a thousand wishes
            'Cause I like to be with you
            But if it's always me and you, and your friend Steve
            There's nothing I can-
            Do-do-do-do-do-do, Steve
            Do-do-do-do-do-do, seriously?
            What's the deal with your friend Steve?
            Hey, you know
            I don't even care how he's doing (how's it go-)
            Steve!</pre>
